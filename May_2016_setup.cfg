# This file defines the setupt of the may 2016 testbeam
# each time a name is set the config file parser will add
# a new fibre mat to the geometry
#
#
# In the 2015 testbeam 4 fibre mats were tested:
# HD2 Uplink 5 and 6
# HD1 Uplink 7 and 8
# CERN4 Uplink 1 and 2
# SLAYER3(DUT) Uplink 3 and 4
#
# Though I ignore the HD1 mat
#
#
# The z-possionts were
# distance between modules in beam direction in the order HD2, Slayer, CERN
# std::vector<double> zPositions = {0., 247.0 * 1000, 469.0 * 1000};
